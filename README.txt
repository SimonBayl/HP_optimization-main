The following project was made in the context of the Optimization for machine learning class in POSTECH.

## Setup
To setup the project, one can either : 
- activate the virtual environment containing all the necessary module by runing in a terminal : 

        .venv\Scripts\activate

- download on the wanted location all the modules by runing in a terminal : 

        pip install -r ./docs/requirements.txt


## Usage

In the `run.py` file, one can uncomment the optimization method that he's interessted in and execute the program with `python .\run.py` and the results will be displayed in the `./results` folder

For the grid search and random grid search, you can also modify the search space directly from the `config.py` file
